# USA-China-Rusia

## What are the tensions between the United States, China, and Russia?
China and Russia say that United States and Europe have interfered on their intern affairs,
which it is not right because other States should not whimsically meddle in the internal
affairs of other counties with the excuse of going on the search of democracy and human
rights to intervene and build their power. Another reason why Russia and China are not
happy with “the West” is because they say United States has been taking unilateral
decisions about international affairs, which they want to take ensemble (Kevin, 2021). We
can see the enmity of Russia and United States really clear in an interview with ABC
New’s George Stephanopoulos in which the actual president Joe Biden said directly that
the Russian president Vladimir Putin was “a killer” and had no soul, and he would
definitely “pay a price” (BBC News Mundo, 2021). The Russian president replied with a
statement in which he recalled all the terrible things that US has done all over its history,
going form the genocide of indigenous people to the actual repression of African
Americans, and wished its homologue good health.
 Both China and Russia are not accepting anymore the imposition of American and
European interests over theirs, neither will they accept the judgement and punishments of
the Western countries only because they do not reach what they call international
standards. Putin policies are designed to never allow Russian pride and dignity to be hurt.
Both China and Russia say anyone will stop them from growing, and they will continue to
work with the Western countries, but never taking the eye off their interests (Kevin, 2021).
 United State says that the aggressiveness and authoritarianism are a threat to the rulesbased order that oversee global stability. Nevertheless, China says that US does not have
the qualification to judge them, because they use its military force and financial strength
to suppress and control other countries, and they use the excuse of national security to
obstruct trade exchange, and at ethe same time encourage other countries to attack China.
We can see an example of these in how United States during the administration of Donald
Trump banned a large list of Chinese brands such as Xiaomi and Comac that have alleged
connections with Chinese military; the Asian giant is sure that it is a political and economic
move (Writer, 2021). 


##  Could this scenario be considered a return to the cold war? Argues
### One of the most important characteristics of the cold war is the division of the world into
two blocs, the Soviet and the American. We know that some of the most powerful
potencies in the world are having conflicts (Russia and China with United States), and we
can see how this conflict has taken a bipolar style. We can see how China and Russia have
started referring to themselves as the anti-West and referring to the Western-style
democracies as “The West” (Writer, 2021); with this we can see how this both countries
have marked a clear division between then and “The West”. Making of this an international
system composed of two blocs: in one hand we have the Sino-Russian bloc, in which we
can also find the countries in which either Russia, China, or both have a considerable
influence (some countries that were part of the URSS, Syria, etc.); in the other hand we
have the West bloc, which is composed of the occidental potencies United States and
Europe, in this bloc we also have their influence countries.
 In addition, we can see how China and Russia have improved their relationship all over
the last decades. Is important to remember that during the 1960’s these countries had a
border conflict, in 1996, after the collapse of the Soviet Union they announced a strategic
partnership, and in 2001 Russian president Vladimir Putin and Jiang Zemin who was the
Chinese president signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of friendship; this Treaty expires in
July, but they have agreed to extend and expand the pact (Conclusion of the «Sino-Soviet
Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance», 2021). They have been having
military exercises altogether, and this autumn the exercise will be held in a Russian district
near Europe, which has the objective to show that they are foreign military ties. United
States and Europe have been imposing sanctions to both countries, Russia has been facing
sanctions for things such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the alleged meddling in the
2016 US presidential election, and the nerve agent attacks on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and
anti-Putin campaigner Alexi Navalny; China faces sanctions for things such as the abuses
over human rights since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown (BBC News, 2021). With
these we can observe the rivalry between these two blocs.
